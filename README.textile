h3. building

ScissDSP will eventually be translated into Scala. As an anticipating step, it now builds with the Simple Build Tool (sbt). Simply run @sbt package@ to compile and package into a @.jar@ file.

You can still check out the older 0.10 version which builds with ant.

h3. linking

If you develop a Scala project using sbt and want it to depend on ScissDSP, you can now add the following line to your project file (sbt 0.7):

pre. val scissdsp = "de.sciss" % "scissdsp" % "0.11"
