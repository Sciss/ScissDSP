### building

ScissDSP will eventually be translated into Scala. As an anticipating step, it now builds with the Simple Build Tool (sbt 0.11). Simply run `sbt package` to compile and package into a `.jar` file.

You can still check out the older 0.10 version which builds with ant.

### linking

If you develop a Scala project using sbt and want it to depend on ScissDSP, you can now add the following line to your sbt build file:

    libraryDependencies += "de.sciss" % "scissdsp" % "0.11" from "https://github.com/downloads/Sciss/ScissDSP/scissdsp-0.11.jar"
